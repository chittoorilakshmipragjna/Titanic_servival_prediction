# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

The model uses passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin details, and family relationships to identify patterns that influenced survival.

The prediction output determines:
- Survived
- Not Survived

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handle missing and inconsistent data
- Visualize survival patterns
- Engineer meaningful features
- Train a classification model
- Evaluate model performance

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The Titanic dataset contains passenger details including:

- Passenger demographics (Age, Gender)
- Ticket information (Fare, Class, Cabin)
- Family relations (SibSp, Parch)
- Port of embarkation
- Survival status

The dataset includes missing values and mixed data types, making it suitable for real-world preprocessing practice.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were performed:

- Survival distribution plot
- Gender vs survival comparison
- Passenger class vs survival analysis
- Age distribution boxplots
- Correlation heatmap

### Key Insights:
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers showed higher survival probability.
- Fare and class influenced survival chances.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing Age values using median imputation
- Filled Embarked with mode
- Replaced missing Cabin values with "Unknown"
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Created new feature **FamilySize**
- Split dataset into training and testing sets (80/20)
